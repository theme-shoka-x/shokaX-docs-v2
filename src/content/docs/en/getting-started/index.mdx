title: Installing ShokaX
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Before You Begin
This document is for the Hexo version of ShokaX. Please make sure you are installing ShokaX based on this system.

To ensure a smooth installation, you will need:
- Node.js version 18 or higher
- A suitable package manager (we recommend using pnpm)

For the sake of saving time in writing the documentation, pnpm is used as the example in this guide.

## Using ShokaX Instant Cans
<Aside type="tip">
This method is only applicable to fresh ShokaX environments version 0.4.5+; for versions below 0.4.5, please refer to the ShokaX-CLI installation guide below.
</Aside>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theme-shoka-x/shokax-can --depth=1
cd shokax-can
pnpm install
hexo s # If you encounter errors, use pnpm dlx hexo s
```
Now a ShokaX environment has been created. The environment created using the instant can is ready to use without any configuration. If you need to create a soft link, refer to the last section of the document.

## Fresh Environment Installation
### Initializing Hexo Environment
```bash
pnpm add hexo-cli -g
# cd your_path
hexo init
# If you encounter an error: pnpm dlx hexo init
```
At this point, you have created a Hexo environment based on the yarn package manager. We recommend switching to pnpm as follows:
```bash
# Please delete the node_modules and yarn.lock files in the corresponding folder
pnpm install
```
### Installing ShokaX
#### Installing ShokaX via Package Manager
```bash
pnpm add hexo-theme-shokax
# For npm/yarn users, you can skip this step, but pnpm users must execute:
node ./node_modules/hexo-theme-shokax/toolbox/hoistdep.mjs
```

#### Installing ShokaX via ShokaX-CLI
<Aside type='caution'>
According to ShokaX's lifecycle plan, ShokaX-CLI has been deprecated. Please avoid using it for new projects.
</Aside>

```bash
pnpm add shokax-cli -g
SXC install shokaX
```

#### Installing ShokaX via Git
<Aside type='tip'>
When installing via Git, we recommend forking a ShokaX GitHub repository and cloning from your fork. This will significantly reduce the difficulty of upgrading after modifying the theme. \
Additionally, ShokaX's git-based installation is not intended for regular users. This process is more complex than using npm or the instant can method and may encounter additional errors.
</Aside>

```bash
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/theme-shoka-x/hexo-theme-shokaX.git # You may replace it with your own project
# Rename the cloned folder to shokax; this name will be used in the following steps
cd shokax
node ./toolbox/compiler.mjs
# Be patient while the compilation is completed
cd ../..
hexo s # Or use pnpm dlx hexo s
# pnpm users must run the following command. For yarn/npm users encountering dependency issues, you can run:
node ./themes/shokax/toolbox/hoistdep.mjs
# After the process is complete, the issue will usually be resolved.
```

At this point, modify `theme` to `shokax`, and ShokaX is ready to use.

## Preliminary Configuration
<Aside type='caution'>
Please note:
- Windows or Mac OS users who do not use CI workflows can ignore this section.
- Linux users must ensure that all configurations related to ShokaX use `shokax`. For example, the theme configuration file should be `_config.shokax.yml`, and the theme should be set to `theme: shokax`. If deploying on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel, this rule should also be followed.

Additionally:
This section involves modifying the `_config.yml` in the Hexo directory. Add or modify the content as specified below.
</Aside>

Change the `theme` in `_config.yml` to `shokax`, and modify `_config.landscape.yml` to `_config.shokax.yml`.

### Necessary Configuration
#### Markdown Configuration
```yml
markdown:
  render: # Renderer settings
    html: false # Filter HTML tags
    xhtmlOut: true # Use '/' to close self-closing tags (e.g., <br />).
    breaks: true # Convert '\n' within paragraphs to <br>.
    linkify: true # Automatically convert text resembling URLs to links.
    typographer:
    quotes: "“”‘’"
  plugins: # markdown-it plugin settings
    - plugin:
        name: markdown-it-toc-and-anchor
        enable: true
        options: # The class names for the table of contents and anchors; ShokaX-based themes must use these settings
          tocClassName: "toc"
          anchorClassName: "anchor"
    - plugin:
        name: markdown-it-multimd-table
        enable: true
        options:
          multiline: true
          rowspan: true
          headerless: true
    - plugin:
        name: ./markdown-it-furigana
        enable: true
        options:
          fallbackParens: "()"
    - plugin:
        name: ./markdown-it-spoiler
        enable: true
        options:
          title: "You know too much"
```

#### Disable Code Highlighting

To disable default code highlighting `(version <= 6.3.0)`:

```yaml
highlight:
  enable: false

prismjs:
  enable: false
```

To disable default code highlighting (version >= `7.0.0-rc1`):

```yaml
syntax_highlighter: false
```

### Recommended Configuration
#### File Compression
Recommended configuration for ShokaX’s built-in compressor:
```yml
minify:
  js:
    enable: false # ShokaX uses esbuild optimization by default, do not enable this; other themes may benefit from enabling.
    exclude: # Exclude files, accepts string[] in micromatch format
  css:
    enable: true # Enable CSS optimization
    options:
      targets: ">= 0.5%" # browserslist format target
    exclude: # Exclude files, accepts string[] in micromatch format
  html:
    minifier: html-minifier
    enable: true # Enable HTML optimization
    options:
      comments: false # Whether to keep comments
    exclude: # Exclude files, accepts string[] in micromatch format
  image:
    enable: false # Enable image preprocessing and automatic WebP conversion
    options:
      avif: false
      webp: true # Reserved configuration, has no effect in the current version
      quality: 80 # Quality, supports integers between 1-100, lossless or nearLossless
      effort: 2 # CPU workload, an integer between 0-6 (lower is faster)
      replaceSrc: false # Automatically replace local image links in HTML with WebP links
      # For users deploying with CI workflows, note that this may cause 404 errors for images. If this occurs, please disable it.
      # We recommend using Service Worker to achieve the replaceSrc functionality on the client side, which will enable non-intrusive link replacement.
    exclude:
```

<Aside type="danger">
`minify.html` introduced the `minifier` option since version 0.1.5, allowing the use of:
- `html-minifier`: More stable
- `minify-html`: Faster

However, due to issues such as [minify-html#181](https://github.com/wilsonzlin/minify-html/issues/181) and [minify-html#170](https://github.com/wilsonzlin/minify-html/issues/170), **minify-html is unreliable and likely to produce incorrect HTML** (e.g., see [ShokaX#220](https://github.com/theme-shoka-x/hexo-theme-shokaX/issues/220) and [ShokaX#243](https://github.com/theme-shoka-x/hexo-theme-shokaX/discussions/243)).

**We do not recommend using `minify-html` until the issues are resolved.**

If you're using version 0.1.4 or earlier, or if you encounter rendering errors when using the `minify-html` minifier, switching the minifier to `html-minifier` will likely resolve the issue.
</Aside>

#### Feed Generation

```yml
feed:
  limit: 20
  order_by: "-date"
  tag_dir: false
  category_dir: false
  rss:
    enable: true
    template: "node_modules/hexo-theme-shokax/layout/_alternate/rss.ejs"
    output: "rss.xml"
  atom:
    enable: true
    template: "node_modules/hexo-theme-shokax/layout/_alternate/atom.ejs"
    output: "atom.xml"
  jsonFeed:
    enable: true
    template: "node_modules/hexo-theme-shokax/layout/_alternate/json.ejs"
    output: "feed.json"
```

## Configuration Recommendations

For easier management, we recommend creating a symbolic link for the theme folder.
